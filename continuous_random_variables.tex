\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute and plot the probability density function of the variable that measures the arrival time.
\item compute and plot the distribution function. 
\item Compute the probability of arriving quarter past six and half past six.
\item What is the expected arrival time?
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $Z$ be a random variable following a standard normal distribution model.
Calculate the following probabilities using the table of the distribution function:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(Z<1.24)$

\item $P(Z>x)=0.0606$.
\item $P(0\leq Z\leq x)=0.4783$.

\item It is known that the glucose level in blood of diabetic persons follows a normal distribution model with
mean 106 mg/100 ml and standard deviation 8 mg/100 ml.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the probability of a random diabetic person having a glucose level less than 120 mg/100 ml. 
\item What percentage of persons have a glucose level between 90 and 120 mg/100 ml?
\item Calculate and interpret the first quartile of the glucose level. 
\end{enumerate}

\item It is known that the cholesterol level in males 30 years old follows a normal distribution with mean 220 mg/dl and
standard deviation 30 mg/dl. 
If there are 20000 males 30 years old in the population,
\begin{enumerate}
\item how many of them have a cholesterol level between 210 and 240 mg/dl?
\item If a cholesterol level greater than 250 mg/dl can provoke a thrombosis, how many of them are in risk of
thrombosis?
\item Calculate the cholesterol level above which 20\% of the males are?
\end{enumerate}

\item In an exam done by 100 students, the average degree is $4.2$ and only 32 students pass.
Assuming that the grade follows a normal distribution model, how many students got a grade greater than 7?

\item In a population with 40000 persons, 2276 have between 0.80 and 0.84 milligrams of bilirubin per deciliter of
blood, and 11508 have more than 0.84.
Assuming that the level of bilirubin in blood follows a normal distribution model, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the mean and the standard deviation.
\item How many persons have more than 1 mg of bilirubin per dl of blood?
\end{enumerate}

\item It is known that the blood pressure of people in a population with 20000 persons follows a normal distribution
model with mean 13 mm Hg and interquartile range 4 mm Hg.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many persons have a blood pressure above 16 mm Hg?
\item How much have to decrease the blood pressure of a person with 16 mm Hg in order to be below the 40\% of
people with lowest blood pressure?
\end{enumerate}

\item A study tries to determine the effect of a low fat diet in the lifetime of rats.
The rats where divided into two groups, one with a normal diet and another with a low fat diet.
It is assumed that the lifetime of both groups follows normal distribution model with the same variance but different
mean.
If 20\% of rats with normal diet lived more than 12 months, 5\% less than 8 moth, and 85\% of rats with low fat diet
lived more than 11 moths,
\begin{enumerate}
\item what is the mean and the standard deviation of lifetime of rats following a low fat diet?
\item If there was 40\% of rats with normal diet, and 60\% of rats with low fat diet, what is the probability that a
random rat die before 9 months?
\end{enumerate}

\item A diagnostic test to determine doping of athletes returns a positive outcome when the concentration of a substance
in blood is greater than 4 $\mu$g/ml.
If the distribution of the substance concentration in doped athletes follows a normal distribution model with mean $4.5$
$\mu$g/ml and standard deviation $0.2$ $\mu$g/ml, and in non-doped athletes follow a normal distribution model with mean
$3$ $\mu$g/ml and standard deviation $0.3$ $\mu$g/ml, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item what is the sensitivity and specificity of the test?
\item If there are a 10\% of doped athletes in a competition, what is the positive predicted value? 
\end{enumerate}

\item According to the central limit theorem, for big samples ($n\geq 30$) the sample mean $\bar x$ follows a normal
distribution model $N(\mu,\sigma/\sqrt{n})$, where $\mu$ is the population mean and $\sigma$ the population standard
deviation.

It is known that in a population the sural triceps elongation has a mean $60$ cm and a standard deviation $15$ cm. 
If you draw a sample of 30 individuals from this population, what is the probability of having a sample mean greater
than 62 cm?
If a sample is atypical if its mean is below the 5th percentile, is atypical a sample of 60 individuals with $\bar
x=57$?

\item The curing time of a knee injury in soccer players follows a normal distribution model with mean 50 days and
standard deviation 10 days.
If there is a final match in 65 days, what is the probability that a player that has just injured his knee will miss the
final?
If the semifinal match is in 40 days, and 4 players has just injured the knee, what is the probability that some of them
can play the semifinal?
